# signet
Deep signaling network experiment


TODO: 
  - explore renormalization to prevent weights from becoming less influenced later on
  - explore other non-gradient based learning strategies
  - implement a freeze weights function to prevent parameter changing
  - define the correct syntactic trees and agents as correct operators as targets
